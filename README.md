# Time Off Toby 
This app is intended to be a PTO management tool for Slack. We are planning to develop this further in the new year.

# Team
- Me (Danny)
- Angela (Pan)

# Plans
- Our planned architecture is here: https://link.excalidraw.com/l/2XpSSiC79LR/ixgMcTp4Ib
- We are planning to use Python and the Slack Bolt API for the application development.
- We are currently intending to use an Azure Function (or multiple) to handle app webhook requests to operate on demand.
- Database will be some variant of Azure Table Storage.

# Where are we now?
- We have planned out the app in detail and are now beginning the implementation (currently the app is essentially just a hello world).
